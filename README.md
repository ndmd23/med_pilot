## My Wish list to digital Santa
### To Create Copilot for Medical Reporting


### Storytime

A year ago I finished medschool in Switzerland. Right about the time machine learning took of with GPT. Hoping on the hype train, I started my journey into coding. Assisted by the somewhat flawed input of ChatGPT. However, It gave me the tools to complete smaller coding projects. 

Recently, I tried out Github Copilot. A revelation! With its recommendations of the correct syntax in autocomplete, you dont have to look up boilerplate code or having to type it out. As a result, it saves time. 
Time, which my collegues working in the clinics miss!

I do not want to start my medical work bound by repetitive reporting. But the implementations of a medical copilot seem to be a few years off! Hindered by a top-down approach, with millions of dollars of a pricetag. And delayed by bureaucracy.


### Goal

Create a tool to make medical reporting easier, like a Medical Copilot

### Implementation Approach

The tool should be implemented on the user level (medical doctors) instead of hospitals
to get around bureaucracy.

### Open Source

I do not have the capabilities to realize such a project. 
I would love to get more capable people working on this.

So if I could make a wish to the digital Santa, that is what I'd wish for ^^

Yours,
A young physician
